# visualising_research
All data and code to make plots from Smethurst et al. (2016) MNRAS, 463, 2986 for Oxford's visualising research scheme. 

Within the project folder, at the command line, type:
 
    jupyter notebook

This will launch an iPython notebook hosted locally on your machine which you interact with via your web browser. Within the browser, open the ```'visualising_research_figures_data.ipynb'``` file. This file contains both descriptions of the data and figures along with code in order to recreate the figures. 

In the drop down menu at the top of the iPython notebook, go to ```Cell > Run all``` in order to recreate all figures. 

You may need to install astropy in order to load the data tables. The easiest way to do that is, from the command line run:

    pip install --no-deps astropy

However, more detailed installation instructions can also be found here: http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html
